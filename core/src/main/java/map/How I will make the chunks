(Example will use a size 9 generation)
I generate the level first, a 9x9 array where each element will be a 'chunk'
After generating the 'Level' each nonzero element will generate a chunk
Within each chunk, each border will be known (Which chunks this generated chunk will be
    adjacent to)
Generate the chunk randomly until all 'doors' (the middle border adjacent tiles) connect
    with the main map
